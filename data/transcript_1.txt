- First thing I'll like to see is a dashboard. But I guess this doesn't show anything because I'm new.

Using Notes
- First thing he did was to save metadata: customer name / company, contact name, industry, title, website,
- Need to know everything about the user's business: No of SKUs, Small, SMB, Enterprise + Detail
- I don't see Save note but see Analyse note.
- Internal and external Highlighter widgets were showing at the same time. Should know you're on the app and disable the other.
- The data on his notes disappeared when he left and came back.
- Will be good to get a notification banner telling me my note has been autosaved
- There's a white circle blocking the title text.
- Went back and the tags he had saved disappeared.
- Notes was suggesting tags outside of his team. Insight7 tags were showing up.
- Clicked on refresh and he got logged him out.
- Should be able to share a note with team after creating. Work in private and share with team.

Library experience
- Notification that your Summary is complete and saved in your library.
- Summariser didn't working (he tried three times)
- Blank page showed after publishing a Note.
- The UX for the link showing within the modal is not good.
- Highlight the title on the Library card with an underline to help me know its clickable.
- No ability to search. I'm the type of guy who likes to search stuff. I want search available across the site and I love to filter by the types of items across the app (e.g notes, insights, recording, customer etc)
- I would like to attach references to my Note e.g summary doc, Transcript and Recording. I also attach my interviewer notes.

Current frustrations and needs in research workflow

(1) Searchability
- the data team have created a database so you can search by keywords.
- Its not smart search. I need filters - search in title, body. E.g When I search Inventory I get a ton of results.
- I spend too much time searching through 100's of docs.
- Should be able to search other teams. This is something I value.

(2) Be able to work directly in the software.
- Say I can record the interview in the same place.
- Create a customer folder or file. Create a doc or spreadsheet
- I want to be able to put the artefacts together. If there's a folder feature.
- I can sort and filter and add notes as I watch a recording.
- I am watching or rewatching a customer interview and taking new notes
- I don't have the tools to put it all in one place. Summaries in one place, Videos in one place
- I create folders on my system. My colleagues want it too.
- Organising - filter by type, sector, customer.
- You can have multiple interviews with a customer within my org and I can see all user interviews done with one customer / account.
- E.g the fulfilment team might have interviewed them and I want to Sort by customer.

Mapping insights to opportunities and solutions at Amazon
- Amazon has a process for mapping insights to what theyâ€™re working on
- We use a doc called PRFAQ which contains key insights from research.
- What goes into the strategy doc in addition to other data points include:
    - Understand the customer from all points of view - internal data and research
    - Industry report and competitive analysis
    - Customer interviews
    - Anything coming from customer support and sales teams
- We capture resources and link them. It's like references in a thesis so anyone can go and validate / dig deeper. The references may or may not be hosted on your product.
- We use a tool called Work docs (Amazon owned tool)
    - Folders where you put notes
    - upload the PRFAQs
    - use these docs to update stakeholders
    - Has versioning - go through previous versions to see the
- Once the PRFAQ is done, the plan flows into roadmap which is also done in Work docs

Mapping insights to opportunities at previous experience
- In my former role we pull out the customer insights, dump into Miro, bring in stakeholders in multiple 90 min sessions
- We assign scores to each insight / pain point
- We use sticky notes to aggregate what the common elements are.
- We then go into solutioning and then roadmap
- I see an opportunity for your tool to organise these flows and link out to reference docs
- You can aggregate this data and export to another tool (Miro or roadmapping)
- Miro has good templates for aggregating insights
- Some people might not know how to organise this process and templates can help automatically organise insights and prioritise problems
