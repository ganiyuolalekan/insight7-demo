How we run our current research process:
- We use Notion to run our interviews
- Tag interviews by persona and segment
- We also record the interview and embed the clip

Things I like about Notion
- I like the way I can start with a template in Notion. Something I would expect from a product like yours

Things I don't like about Notion
- Its not easy for us to grab insights or highlight within this interview and say these are the insights we got from this interview
- I wish this product would get integrated into our Opportunity Solution Tree (the outcome we're chasing)
- We use this framework to evaluate multiple opportunities we're chasing to get an outcome.
- We also use it to validate assumptions we need to pass before we start building.
- We're doing this in doing it in Figma and the research from Notion isn't integrated.
- Now we can't connect research to those decisions, we just ask ourselves - do we feel confident in making this decision now?

What I'm looking for
- I would like a research tool that enables the research be integrated into our goals
- Our outcome is centred around finding PMF. This is what we're trying to solve for.
- We come up with a bunch of opportunities and then we come up with solutions for those opportunities. We look the opportunities and there are assumptions which we need to test.
- An insight can be applied to an opportunity, a solution or establishing an assumption.

Feedback on Dashboard UX
- We are currently doing competitor pricing tracking so that will be useful
- Recent activity also looks useful. If Iâ€™m looking for something or seeing someone just created this insight.
- I wouldn't know what do with the Overview card. Don't know how that would be useful.
