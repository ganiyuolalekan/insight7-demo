What is painful today
- I find the entire process difficult - scheduling,  summarising, synthesising across sources
- The workflow is expensive, categorisation is expensive
- I would like to know through the process, what are the pieces I’m missing
- How do you capture stories that help you build a mental model
- Stack ranking that and understanding the context

My research workflow
- I talk to internal teams, try to understand their motivation, goals, their angle. How do you shape and mould that
- Tools capture what you did, how do we make conclusions
- Gong - you have the recording, I still need to listen, watch the recording
- Is there existing research, existing feedback research from forums, slack
- Talking to key teams, support, examples of things we’ve see (e.g slack), schedule meetings with team
- Sourcing people for our early adopter program, user testing with non-Coda users
- Recorded interviews, taking notes on the side, some times you do a survey.
- Most times, I do research myself. We don’t have enough researchers, sometimes its self-service
- Sometimes, I’ll join a call and participate

Most painful part of the workflow
    1) Synthesis across various sources of info - video, text, survey is expensive across various sources and apps
    2) Coordination of it - scheduling. How do I coordinate
- Willingness to pay - I would use researcher salaries per hour to evaluate value
- Insights level, you can summarise, you’re giving me back time. Office 365 subscription fees
- Accelerating my time to insight
- Without importers, it might be a big lift
- Insights
    - OKRs, Now Next later
    - Simple - Keep it simple
    - Categorise the model, make decisions on the investments
    - Free form representation could be cards, tags
    - Detailed list, I can group by investments, OKRs, and scan in then
    - Hey I want to make 10% in delighter, 20% in accelerators
- I would like a workflow that guides me once I come in e.g I came here to do a research project - here a bunch of things you can get started with.
- Data to insights first
- Extract insights from
- Iconography can help
